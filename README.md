# Project Interaction by Facial Expressions

Interacting with a web application only by using facial expressions? That was the overarching question of the Project Interaction by Facial Expressions. In an attempt to answer this, the project uses theoretical concepts and tries to put those findings into practice. For that a realtime web application (prototype) was developed. According to the lecture description, it consists of a photo gallery with a couple of appliable filters. The webcam lays in the center of the application, since it is used to analyze and evaluate the interactions of the user. Generally the prototype can be operated by facial expressions as well as head rotation, without any additional equipment. The goal was summarized in the following sentence: "Operate a photo gallery and image manipulation website (almost) entirely by using the face and head".

To use the prototype, it is crucial to use the backend and the frontend. Explanations of installation can be found in the [backend README](./backend/README.md) and [frontend README](./frontend/README.md). 

This project was created for the lecture Mediaprocessing in the winter semester of 2023/2024 by Lea Krawczyk, Thi Mai Linh Nguyen and Sebastian Vittinghoff.
