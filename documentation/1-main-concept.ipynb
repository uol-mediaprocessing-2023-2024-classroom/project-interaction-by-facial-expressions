    "# Main concept (08.11.2023)\n",
    "Our goal is to develop an application that makes it possible to take photos using a webcam and save them into a gallery. The user can also upload photos from their computer to the gallery. This gallery can be navigated by using gestures and facial expressions. In addition, the user should be able to modify the images by applying different filters. These filters should be triggered by certain gestures and facial expressions. We refer to the gestures and facial expressions as **commands**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example of commands\n",
    "\n",
    "As of now we decided to implement the following commands to our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Go to next photo &rarr; Close your right eye\n",
    "* Go to previous photo &rarr; Close your left eye\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Take a photo &rarr; Connect thumb and index finger\n",
    "* Undo &rarr; Close both eyes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filters:\n",
    "* Blur Image &rarr; Hold hand in front of eyes\n",
    "* Black and white &rarr; Peace sign\n",
    "* Invert &rarr; Thumbs down\n",
    "\n",
    "To test these commands, our plan is to analyze static images first. We think that this is going to be easier than analyzing the facial expressions and gestures through the live video feed, especially because we have to figure out the connection of frontend and backend. The way this is going to work is, that the user takes a picture of the gesture/facial expression and that is the command. On clicking the photo button of the webcam, a timer is triggered which counts down, so the user has time to position themselves. \n",
    "Once we figure out how to connect the frontend and backend, so the images of the webcam can analyzed in real time, the user will not have to use a button anymore, instead the action is triggered immediatly by the command. \n",
    "\n",
    "## GUI wireframe\n",
    "As we settled on our commands we created a wireframe of the frontend of our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main area features a webcam view right in the middle of the screen. We decided to place the webcam view in the middle since the user tends to look at the webcam view rather than the webcam itself which is usually placed in the middle at the top of the screen. This way we can track the eye movements more accurately. \n",
    "There is a smaller view in the top right corner of the webcam view which shows the photo taken. At the bottom of the webcam view there is a camera button which takes a photo if pressed. As of now we are still testing the implementations of our commands so there is a camera button to take a photo.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the right side of the webcam view there is a command log which shows the last five commands done by the user. On the left side of the webcam view there is going to be a \"Help\" symbol which will show the possible command inputs if the user clicks on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the webcam view there is going to be an area to modify a photo by applying filters. On both sides of the modifying area there are going to be previews of the next photo in the album and the previous photo. Below the modifying area there is an undo button to rollback changes to the photo, if for example a wrong command was detected. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>If the user scrolls further down, they can view all of their photos in a gallery. There is going to be an area where the user can upload their photos which can be modified as well.</p>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./assets/gui-concept-with-photos.png\" alt=\"Concept of GUI with photos\" width=\"640\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>We also created an alternative wireframe of the application for our planned future state, once the user does not have to take a picture first to use the input commands. We only removed the photo button and the previous command image from the top right coner of the webcam view.</p>\n",
