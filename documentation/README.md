# Documentation

Our goal is to create project where the user can operate a photo gallery and image manipulation website (almost) entirely by using the face and head.

This documentation contains the progress updates of this project over time.
[main.ipynb](./main.ipynb) consists of a progress summary section where each update is summarised. Furthermore there is an overview of the task distribution, known issues and an outlook of this project.
Each major update has its own chapter (1-6) where the progress is documented in detail.
