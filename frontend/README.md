# Frontend

## Requirements

In order for the dependencies to be installed, it must be ensured that Node.js is already installed on the system or that this is done before. You can find a link to the installation file [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Afterwards the package manager yarn must then be activated with the following command:

```shell
corepack enable
```

## Setup

To install the dependencies, execute the following command:

```shell 
yarn
```

## Start

To start the frontend, execute the following command:

```shell 
yarn run start
```

The frontend can then be opened at http://localhost:3000 via the web browser.

**The Prototype was developed with Chrome. It is therefore strongly recommended to open it in Chrome.**
